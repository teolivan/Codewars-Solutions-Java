/*Bob needs a fast way to calculate the volume of a cuboid with three values: the length, width and height of the cuboid. Write a function to help Bob with this calculation. */

//My Solution

public class Kata {

    public static double getVolumeOfCuboid(final double length, final double width, final double height) {
      double volume = length * width * height;
      return volume;
    }
    
  }
